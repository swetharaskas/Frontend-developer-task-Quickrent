# QuickRent Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive landing page for the mock startup **QuickRent**, a platform for renting gadgets like laptops, cameras, and gaming consoles. The page showcases:

- A modern design with sections for the hero banner, platform features, gadget listings, plan comparisons, and a contact form.
- Responsiveness for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Subtle animations, such as hover effects and a mobile-friendly hamburger menu.

### Key Features
- **Hero Section:** Eye-catching introduction with a call-to-action button.
- **Platform Features:** Highlights of key offerings with icons for visual appeal.
- **Gadget Listing:** Displays available gadgets with pricing and descriptions.
- **Plan Comparison Table:** Simplifies selection with a tabular breakdown of rental plans.
- **Contact Form:** Enables user inquiries with a simple, user-friendly design.

### Technical Stack
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for semantic markup and styling.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity (e.g., mobile navigation).
- Responsive design using CSS media queries.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd quickrent-landing-page
   ```

3. **Open the HTML File**
   Open `web2.html` in any modern web browser.

   ```bash
   open web2.html
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can host the project locally using an HTTP server for better compatibility:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

4. **View the Landing Page**
   Explore the features, test responsiveness by resizing the browser window, and interact with the navigation and form elements.

## Design Approach

- **Accessibility:** Ensured readable fonts, sufficient contrast, and straightforward navigation.

## Future Improvements
